### Known Bugs: {#bugs}
In the event that (disallowed values) are entered into [MORE INFO] If you experience this issue, please message the producer of your current repository and include any relevant form/page information. Thank you for your patience as I work on any issues!

The page may experience formatting issues when opened on mobile devices or tablets/laptops in smaller windows. Page should still be legible but general project layout will shift in potentially unforeseen manner. Thus, it is recommended to open the HTML index page in browser or file explorer in as full a screen as hardware allows.

Additionally, included image does not scale-down to fit to smaller screen sizes and may take up a majority of the screen when scrolling through the site from a mobile (or other small-screened) device.
